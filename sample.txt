hey
there
delilah
what's t's like in New York City ?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Time square can't shine as bright as you
I swear, it's true

Update :->
Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side
